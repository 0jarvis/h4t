A website I designed for a group of my friends to start an online fruit bussiness within college.

We'll categorise the problem in 2 parts:
1.) UI/UX problem
2.) Backend

UI/UX problems
It requires a lot of changes like:
- Better responsive design for every screen size
- Better Animation style for the Form

Backend Problems

> Current problems:
- Security
- Order menu should have cart.
- Cancel option for orders.
- Change option for ordered one.
- PHP for placed order has a bug.

> Functionality:
- Invoice of Placed Order available for print and should be mailed.
- Database could be added for orders. (For now simply stored in PHP)
- Account creation for regular automatic orders
- Messenginig platform using AJAX and Erlang
- Mobile App Development!

What can be done to make this website have more functionality???
